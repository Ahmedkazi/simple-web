                <h2>London</h2>
                <p>
                    Flights to London take you to a city of unforgettable landmarks. Buckingham Palace, Wembley Stadium, Big Ben, Regent’s Park, Camden Town, Notting Hill, the London Underground – the list of things to do and see in London is endless. (This includes giant Ferris wheel the London Eye, the perfect vantage point for taking it all in).

Thankfully, it’s a city built for walking – and those who don’t want to walk can hire a ‘Boris Bike’ from one of the 700 bicycle docking stations around the city. Plus, flights to London would be wasted if you don’t travel on the famous London Underground or hop on one of the iconic double-decker buses while you’re there.

                <h2>Maldives </h2>
                <p>
                Flights to Malé, lying as it does among the scattered islands of the Maldives, are popular with those in search of serious relaxation among some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.

                There are those who think of Malé as merely a gateway to those picture-perfect islands (which it isn’t, as the main airport is on the neighbouring island of Hulhulé). But stick around in the capital a little longer and you will find a miniature jungle of winding streets, high-rise buildings and a diverse and fascinating culture.

                <h2>Dubai</h2>
                <p>
                    Try and get a seat by the window for your flights to Dubai – as the plane descends, you'll want to see the sheer scale of its dramatic sprawl along the coastline, which is just as impressive as its skyline. In little more than 40 years, this city has transformed itself from a tiny settlement to a glittering metropolis and world-class destination.

While Dubai's startling feats of engineering such as the Burj Khalifa, the Palm islands, Burj Al Arab and The Dubai Mall are jewels in its crown, the city’s multi-faceted appeal extends to more than just its architecture. Some people are attracted to the buzz of the place – the frenetic pace and energy of a global business city and tourism hub. However, you might prefer the tranquillity of its desert retreats, golf courses, calm seas and beaches.
